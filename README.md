# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Time Spent
I spent almost 02 hours to complete this project.

## Best Practices
The following best practices have been implemented in the code:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is broken down into reusable components.
- **State Management**: Managed state using React's useState and Custom hook useFormat for format data in functional components.
- **Custom Hook**: Used Custom hook useFormat for format data.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS to prevent global styles from affecting component-specific styles.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Ensured code quality and consistency with ESLint and Prettier.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.
- **Error Boundaries**: Implemented error boundaries to handle errors gracefully in the UI.
